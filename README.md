# VideoWatch

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

I hated keep getting video links from social media but whenever i want to watch them i needed to be logged in or register so this is what i wanted to change just make a simple 1 pager where u can paste your link and just watch the funny video u wanted to watch without have to login
